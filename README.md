Dual-Model AI System: ResNet50 + EfficientNet ensemble learning

Smart Exclusion Logic: Automatic filtering of mountains, snow, and non-forest areas

Real-time Processing: Results in under 30 minutes

Interactive Dashboard: User-friendly web interface with interactive maps

Customizable Analysis: Adjustable thresholds and parameters

Export Capabilities: CSV reports and visual exports
Python 3.8+: Main programming language
# core tools
TensorFlow 2.12: Machine learning framework
